            <h1>The number</h1>
            <p>
                His shirt on the Lakers was number 8, but from the 2006-07 season it became 24. Some say because of Michael Jordan's number 23, others say it was just a "turn in time" of the star, who had already used this numbering before in High School. But the strongest rumor is that Nike, its supplier of sporting goods would have asked him to change the number, since Adidas, which supplied the equipment for Bryant previously, still has tennis lines that use the brand Bryant number 8 of the player.
